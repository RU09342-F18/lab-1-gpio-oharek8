# Assignment
The assignment this time was to use a button as an input.

# Summary of Code
In both versions of the code, the LED turn on if the button is pressed and off when it is released. This is done by performing a
button check within a while loop. When the button is pressed the input pin is tied to ground and its value becomes 0. When this 
is realized by the code it turns the LED on. Otherwise, the LED remains off.
